# ODIN_restaurant


### Scope
Ths assignement includes a number of instructions:
- apply newly learnt concepts/tools: npm package, webpack, ES6 modules
- code in modules (each page - home/menu/contact - written in separate modules)
- the logic / event listeners to be in index.js

I have tried to keep the code and website very simple to focus essentially on the elements learnt in the lesson.


### Instructions
$ npx webpack --watch



### Credits
Thank you to the Odin Project and team.
