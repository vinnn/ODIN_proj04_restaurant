# ODIN_restaurant

## Motivation
This project is to practice the concepts learned in the Odin Project - Full Stack Javascript - Javascript lessons.
- Javascript. Code in modules (each page - home/menu/contact - written in separate modules)
- the logic / event listeners to be in index.js

I have tried to keep the code and website very simple to focus essentially on the elements learnt in the lesson.

## Concepts covered
- HTML5, CSS, Javascript
- Git/Github
- npm package, webpack, ES6 modules

### Instructions
$ npx webpack --watch
